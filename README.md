# LossLess protocol security

The Lossless Protocol offers a novel security layer for ERC20 token contracts, providing an essential safeguard against fraudulent transactions and hacks. It integrates directly into token contracts through the LERC20 standard, allowing for the detection and prevention of unauthorized token transfers. In the event of suspicious activity, Lossless Protocol enables token owners to freeze transactions before they are finalized, effectively mitigating potential financial losses. Additionally, it incorporates a recovery mechanism, giving token owners the ability to retrieve tokens wrongfully taken in hacks. This comprehensive security approach ensures that token ecosystems are not only more secure but also resilient against the evolving threats in the blockchain space, thus protecting the interests of token holders and maintaining the integrity of the Saakuru Protocol ecosystem.
